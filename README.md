# Face-to-BMI Prediction System

This project aims to predict Body Mass Index (BMI) from face images. Our team implemented and compared two different approaches for BMI prediction: a VGG-Face model using TensorFlow/Keras and a ResNet50 model using PyTorch.

### Experiments

Our team conducted different experiments using complementary approaches to tackle the same problem:
